Controlled Vocabularies
-----------------------

There are many points in the DDI where a controlled vocabulary is
desired, but no single classification can be (or has been) identified
which would be acceptable to all user communities. DDI-L provides a
CodeValueType that allows for use of a simple descriptive term while
also supporting the use of an externally described controlled
vocabulary. A set of fields has been made available for identifying the
following information about the controlled vocabulary including; the
name or identifier, maintenance agency, version, and URL of the
controlled vocabulary. DDI is supporting the option of developing and
publishing controlled vocabularies expressed in a DDI profile of
Genericode. These may be used directly or incorporated into local
publications of controlled vocabularies that reflect those elements that
are common with the DDI community and adding those that are specific to
the maintenance agency.

This approach supports sharing of common coding structures as well as
the publication of code schemes in formats that can be mapped for
comparability. DDI publishes a set of controlled vocabularies commonly
used in social science research
(http://www.ddialliance.org/controlled-vocabularies). These are
presented in a variety of formats including Genericode XML.
