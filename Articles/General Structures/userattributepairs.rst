User Attribute Pairs
----------------------

UserAttributePair is a structure that supports the use of a user specified standard key value pair, this can be attached to any VersionableType, (these are listed in the documentation for UserAttributePair).

The intent of this structure is that it allows the addition of business specific metadata for primarily internal processes that is not likely to be widely shared between different organisations.

Examples of usage would be:

- Holding adhoc information about individuals such as place and date of birth, 
- Adding additional functionality to an existing element such as a controlled vocabulary to copyright to support internal systems.
