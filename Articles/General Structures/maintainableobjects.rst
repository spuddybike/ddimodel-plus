Maintainable Objects: Modules and Schemes
-----------------------------------------

Maintainable objects are of two basic types, Modules and Schemes.

Modules roughly relate to stages in the life cycle or publishing
packages. Publishing packages pull together related material regarding a
study, a series or group of studies, reusable resources, or deposited
objects. Modules like DataCollection, LogicalProduct,
PhysicalDataProduct, and ConceptualComponents bring together sets of
information related to specific activities, the results of a study, or
conceptual background. They may include other modules, schemes, or
non-scheme based objects.

Schemes are designed to bring together sets of similar objects (i.e.
Variables, Concepts, RecordLayouts, etc.) which are managed as a unit
for either conceptual or administrative purposes. Schemes have a common
structure providing descriptive information about the scheme, a set of
similar objects, and the ability to group those objects for
administrative purposes.
