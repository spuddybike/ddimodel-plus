Type of Identifier
------------------

DDI 3.2 supports two formats for expressing the Identification Sequence
as a URN. The Canonical URN is recommended. The Deprecated URN is a
modification of the DDI 3.1 URN. Whether the identification information
is expressed as a URN or using the Identification Sequence the attribute
“typeOfIdentifier” on the URN dictates the format of the URN supported
internally by the agency and the format of the URN used by an external
reference to that object. Note that regardless of the type of identifier
used it is good practice to provide the full content of the
Identification Sequence and details of the MaintainableObject for
non-Maintainable objects in order to support the creation of any format
of a DDI URN.
