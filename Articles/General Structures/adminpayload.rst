Administrative and Payload Metadata
-----------------------------------

The differentiation between Administrative metadata and Payload metadata
lies primarily in how changes to the metadata content drive version
changes.

*Administrative metadata* is content that is related to the interaction
or use of the metadata within a specific system. Changes in
administrative metadata do not change the meaning of the metadata
content of the object in terms of its DDI identification or intellectual
meaning. For example, the addition of a local User Identification to
facilitate interaction between the metadata object and local access
software, or creating a URN entry from existing identification sequence
content are considered to be changes to the Administrative metadata. A
change in Administrative metadata does not trigger a change in the
version number of a published object.

*Payload metadata* is all metadata NOT defined as Administrative.
Payload metadata contains intellectual content that has an impact on the
meaning or application of the object. A change in Payload metadata
generally triggers a change in the version number of a published object.
