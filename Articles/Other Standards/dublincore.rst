Dublin Core and MARC
--------------------

All citations in DDI-L provide the option of entering a supplemental
citation in native qualified Dublin Core (DCTerms). In addition, the
contents of both qualified Dublin Core and the more extensive MARC
record can be mapped to objects in DDI-L. DDI-L has divided the contents
of these records to a number of complex element groups within DDI to
facilitate reuse of specific sub-structures. The major divisions
include:

-  Citation – This structure is used for both DDI content citations and
   citations for external materials.

-  Coverage – Temporal, Topical, and Spatial coverage map to content
   coverage dates, subject and keyword topics, and geographic coverage
   elements. They are held separately in DDI-L in order to allow
   coverage constraint for modules within a single StudyUnit or Group.

-  Location Specific Information – Some information such as acquisition
   date, call number, local identifiers, etc. are related to a specific
   holding and are therefore located in the ArchiveSpecific section of
   the ArchiveModule. This facilitates packaging for transfer and
   incorporation into a different archive.
