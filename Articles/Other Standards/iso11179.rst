ISO/IEC 11179
-------------

DDI-L reflects ISO/IEC 11179 structure in several respects. First, it
maps the core structures Concept, Universe, ConceptualVariable, and
RepresentedVariable to the ISO/IEC 11179 Data Element Classification
Structure. The structure presented in DDI 3.2 aligns with the
representation of this ISO standard through the GSIM structure. (See
GSIM discussion within this section).

Secondly, DDI-L has adopted the combination of the Agency, ID, and
Version as the full unique identification of an object. This is
reflected in the identification model and content of the DDI URN.
Finally, DDI-L has incorporated the ISO/IEC 11179-5 structure of
providing a Name, Label, and Description for all primary objects
(maintainable and versionable) that are not considered publication
structures. Publication structures have complete citation information
plus an abstract. The objects with this common descriptive set are those
that are commonly managed with registries over time.
