PREMIS
-------

PREMIS is a common implementation of Open Archive Information System
(OAIS). There is a preliminary mapping of DDI-L to PREMIS objects. The
focus of PREMIS is preservation and there are several elements where
DDI-L does not provide controlled content. However, with the ability to
publish controlled vocabularies external to the DDI specification, we
should be able to address all but a few of the PREMIS objects. Further
alignment with OAIS requirements as expressed in PREMIS and other
preservation will take place as DDI-L expands into process models,
provenance, and archive management content.
