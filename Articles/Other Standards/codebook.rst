DDI Codebook (DDI-C) and earlier versions
-----------------------------------------

After conceptualizing the lifecycle model and the design rules for
reuse, DDI-C content was distributed to the schemas comprising DDI-L.
Specific mapping of objects from DDI-C to DDI-L brought to light a
number of specific issues which were then addressed during DDI â€“L
revisions. While specific objects may not always have a specific 1:1
correlation in 3.0, the content of all 2.1 objects has been captured,
often in greater detail or a more consistent manner than in earlier DDI
versions. During the development of DDI 3.2 changes were made in DDI-C
to incorporate more content from the Generic Statistical Business
Process Model (GSBPM) and to add objects that would ease the translation
of DDI-C into DD-L. These objects were also added to DDI-L if not
already present.
