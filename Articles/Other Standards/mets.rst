METS
----

METS is a standard developed as an initiative of the Digital Library
Federation and provides a consistent outer wrapper for digital objects
described by a variety of METS profiles. The METS structure was
consulted in developing the structure for the Collection and Item
objects in Archive and the intent is to write and register a METS
Profile for DDI.
